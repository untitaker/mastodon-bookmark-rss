          This service requires JS to be enabled. Its use of JS is rather
          trivial, but prevents the secret feed URL from being leaked into your
          browser history.

      <ul>
        <li>
          This service does not store your bookmarks. All needed credentials
          are encoded in the RSS feed's URL.
        </li>

        <li>
          This service acts on a user's behalf. It requires explicit setup by a
          user, like for example a mobile client. Therefore, like a mobile
          client, this service does <strong>not</strong> respect
          <code>robots.txt</code>.
        </li>

        <li>
          This service is open-source, and the code can be found on
          <a href="https://github.com/untitaker/mastodon-bookmark-rss">GitHub</a
          >. Anybody can run it. Therefore, anybody can modify their
          installation of it to do things that are not documented here.
        </li>

        <li>
          The corresponding user-agent for this service is of the form
          <code
            >mastodon-bookmark-rss/&lt;version&gt;
            (+&lt;installation_url&gt;)</code
          >. <code>installation_url</code> will point to the public URL of
          wherever this software is hosted, on a best-effort basis.
        </li>

        <li>
          This service enforces some basic rate limits. Any
          reasonable RSS feed reader should not run into them.
          Please don't poll your RSS feed more often than you
          actually need, this relieves this service and your
          Mastodon server.
        </li>
